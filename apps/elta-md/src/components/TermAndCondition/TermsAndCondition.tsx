          These terms and conditions of sale (“Terms of Sale”) apply in the
          event you make a purchase of a Product through our Services. These
          Terms of Sale incorporate the general terms and conditions for our
          Service (the “Terms of Use”). OUR TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A MANDATORY
          ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN THE TERMS OF USE,
          REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE
          DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS OR
          CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. In the event that there is a conflict
          between a provision of these Terms of Sale and a provision of the
          Terms of Use, the provision of these Terms of Sale shall prevail.
          These Terms of Sale contain very important information regarding your
          rights and obligations, as well as conditions, limitations and
          exclusions that might apply to you. Please read these Terms of Sale
          carefully before ordering from us. By ordering Products on or through
          our Service, you are agreeing to these Terms of Sale. IF YOU DO NOT
          AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SALE, DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. You may not
          order or obtain Products or services from the Service unless you (a)
          agree to these terms and are (b) 18 years of age or older. Capitalized
          terms used but not defined in these Terms of Sale shall have the
          meaning set forth in the Terms of Use.

          The Service may make available listings, descriptions and images of
          goods or services (collectively, “Products”), as well as references
          and links to such Products. Such Products may be made available by us,
          and may be made available for any purpose, including for purchase or
          general information purposes. Any Products sold on or through this
          Service are sold solely for personal use and are not intended for
          resale. We make no representations as to the completeness, accuracy,
          reliability, validity or timeliness of such listings, descriptions or
          images (including any features, specifications and prices contained
          therein). Such information and the availability of any Product
          (including the validity of any coupon or discount) are subject to
          change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures and
          similar descriptions are approximate and are for convenience only. We
          make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of
          Products, including the applicable colors, however the actual colors
          you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee
          that your computer will accurately display such colors.

          2.1 We may make available the ability to purchase or otherwise obtain
          certain Products through the Service (a “Transaction”). If you wish to
          make a Transaction, you may be asked to supply certain relevant
          information, such as your credit card number and its expiration date,
          your billing address and your shipping information. You represent and
          warrant that you have the right to use any method of payment that you
          submit in connection with a Transaction. By submitting such
          information, you grant to us the right to provide such information to
          third parties for purposes of facilitating Transactions. Verification
          of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or
          completion of any Transaction. By making a Transaction, you represent
          that the applicable Products will be used only in a lawful manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.2 We reserve the right, including without prior notice, to limit the
          available quantity of or discontinue making available any Product; to
          impose conditions on the honoring of any coupon, discount or similar
          promotion; to bar any user from making any Transaction; and to refuse
          to provide any user with any Product. Refunds and exchanges will be
          subject to our applicable return policy (if any). You agree to pay all
          charges incurred by you or on your behalf through the Service, at the
          prices in effect when such charges are incurred, including all
          shipping and handling charges. In addition, you are responsible for
          any taxes applicable to your Transactions. While it is our practice to
          confirm orders by e-mail, the receipt of an e-mail order confirmation
          does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of
          an offer to sell a Product. Without limiting any of the foregoing, we
          are not responsible for pricing, typographical and other errors in any
          offer by us and we reserve the right to cancel any orders arising from
          such error.
